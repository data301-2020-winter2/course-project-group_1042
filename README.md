## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We're interested in the medical expenses database as healthcare is an important area of study especially during these times in which healthcare costs are increasing due to the pandemic. What we hope to be able to do here is to find a trend between medical costs and any other attribute such as the number of children a family has, if the person is a smoker or a non-smoker, age, bmi, as well as if healthcare costs are higher in a specific region of the United States. The biggest thing that we want to look at is if there is an increased/decreased medical expenses cost between regions. After figuring out which regions rank higest/lowest we will look at the other points of data we have in order to then try to determine a factor that might cause these changes in medical costs, albeit culture, age demography, etc. We feel that this data set is appropiate for us to later create a data dashboard around it as the data seems simple and straightforward enough.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset we are interested in talks about healthcare and medical costs throughout the United States. A very small sample of the US population was asked about a couple of personal details (pressumbaly to look for any correlation relating to healthcare costs) throughout the entire United States. Some of these details include their age, sex, bmi, number of children, if they smoke, their region relative to the entire US, and their healthcare costs. This data was uploaded to Kaggle, and takes its origin from a book by Brett Lantz and Packt Publishing. This data was taken as a sample metric in order to be used by students in projects relating to data science or machine learning such as this one. There is no information regarding how recent the information is and when the data was collected, but for the purposes of this project we'll use this data as a tool to learn how to read, interpret, and analyze a dataset.
