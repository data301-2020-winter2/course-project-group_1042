## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We're interested in the medical expenses database as healthcare is an important area of study especially during these times in which healthcare costs are increasing due to the pandemic. What we hope to be able to do here is to find a trend between medical costs and any other attribute such as the number of children a family has, if the person is a smoker or a non-smoker, age, bmi, as well as if healthcare costs are higher in a specific region of the United States. The biggest thing that we want to look at is if there is an increased/decreased medical expenses cost between regions. After figuring out which regions rank higest/lowest we will look at the other points of data we have in order to then try to determine a factor that might cause these changes in medical costs, albeit culture, age demography, etc. We feel that this data set is appropiate for us to later create a data dashboard around it as the data seems simple and straightforward enough.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The data was collected from a small sample of the US population and it was covering medical insurance cost. The data set was sorted on the following categories: age, sex, bmi, number of children, smoker, region and costs. This dataset can be used to find how these specific categories impact medical costs. The data was obtained from Kaggle.
